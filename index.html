							As a ML Engineer at DHL Group, I focus on deploying Machine Learning applications and big data ETL-Pipelines using Kubeflow on a Azure Kubernetes Cluster. My role further involves refactoring data science code for cloud deployment, incorporating CI/CD workflows via GitHub Actions for testing and code quality assurance.
							<br>
							Due to confidentiality agreements, I can unfortunatley not disclose specifics of my projects at DHL. Instead, I am excited to use this website for showcasing my pet projects.
														
							<!--
							Below is a portfolio of the pet project I am legally allowed to share. Before joining  
							DHL Group, I was employed at the University of Cologne as a research assistant, initially working on the following topics such as
							<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> theoretical game theory. <br /><br />
								
							The mathematical intensity of 
							this pursuit proved valuable for my later data-driven and programming-intensive projects. Along the way, I programmed 
							a script that uses the Lemke-Howson-Algorithm to solve games for Nash equilibria (see 
							"Homotopy Methods for solving Non-Degenerate Bimatrix Games"). While in "The Effects of Walth 
							Shocks on Health", I replicate the findings of a well published empirical paper using the same data.
							 If you value clean coding, I strongly advise you not to check out 
							these projects, since going through the code could cause you physical pain. 
							Fortunately, this does not apply to more recent projects. 
							<br><br>
							On a more serious note, I believe that I was very well trained in econometrics through my research work and studies,
							 but learned too little about our day-to-day data analysis tools.  This dangerous half-knowledge has led me 
							to take a step back in 2021 and learn more about the deep-rooted fundamentals of computer science, software engineering and the 
							programming in C. To that end, I enrolled in several CS50x courses from HarvardX, which I expect to 
							complete in 2023. Keep posted, I am looking forward to making the final project available here 
							(see "HavardX CS50x (Soon Available)").
							<br><br>
							More recent projects involve the data analysis 
							underlying my working paper published in early 2022 (see "Developing a Framework for Real-Time Trading 
							in a Laboratory Financial Market by Mark Marner-Hausen"). The analysis is performed in Python and features sophisticated 
							data engineering using data from a laboratory experiment on algorithmic trading at millisecond speed.
							<br><br>
							One of the latest projects, "A Horse Race to classify Amazon Kindle Reviews",
							examines 1,000,000 reviews from the Amazon Kindle Book Store and conducts a horse race between different 
							supervised machine learning classification models. The second project, "Emojis as Labels & ROC-AUC vs. Average Precision",
							uses emojis from tweets to label these tweets as containing either positive or negative emotions, conducting a sentiment analysis
							subsequently and discussing the performance in terms of ROC-AUC vs. Average Precision.
							The third project, "Mountain Car & Neural Networks (Soon Available)", addresses a classical benchmark problem for 
						 	reinforcement learning algorithms. This project attempts to solve the problem using neural networks.
